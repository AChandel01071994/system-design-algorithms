#### Quadtree
- Spatial search
- Image Union/Intersection
- Find nearby interest points

#### Rtree
- Spatial search
- Find nearby interest points

#### Ray casting algorithm
- Check if a point in polygon

####  Leaky bucket/Token bucket algorithm
A mechanism to control the amount and the rate of the traffic sent to the network

#### Geohash/S2 Geometry
- Used by dating apps to find romantic matches within a particular cell, and to create chat apps.
- Find nearby locations, and identify places of interest, restaurants, shops and accommodation establishments in an area.
- Geohashers go on global expeditions to meet people and explore new places.

#### Trie
Trie is an efficient information reTrieval data structure. Using Trie, search complexities can be brought to optimal limit (key length)
